# Desktop images

The portal offers Ubuntu KDE, Ubuntu Desktop (GNOME), Fedora Workstation
(GNOME), and Linux Mint (Cinnamon). KDE uses the pinned LinuxServer Webtop image;
the other three use these custom images built on pinned LinuxServer Selkies bases.
They contain desktop environments and applications, rather than full installer
ISOs or virtual machines. All use the existing authenticated browser gateway.

Build on the desktop host from this directory:

```bash
docker build -t ephemio/ubuntu-gnome:VERSION ubuntu-gnome/
docker build -t ephemio/fedora-gnome:VERSION fedora-gnome/
docker build -t ephemio/mint-cinnamon:VERSION mint-cinnamon/
docker image inspect ephemio/ubuntu-gnome:VERSION --format '{{.Id}}'
```

Register each tested image's immutable ID in `/etc/ephemio/config.json` under
`profiles`; see [host operations](../host/README.md). Build tags are convenient
names; the worker runs immutable image IDs. Package repositories change, so
rebuilding a Dockerfile can produce a different image even with a pinned base.
Test a rebuilt image before replacing its configured ID.

Ubuntu uses Noble's GNOME 46, Ubuntu Dock and Yaru with Mozilla's native Firefox
package. Mint uses signed Zena packages on its Noble base, Cinnamon 6.6 and Mint
themes. The included Mint keyring package has SHA-256
`b71be690c543112ea7b65f43e9bbce9a3f17dd5cc784074858f0824154942a99`.

Fedora uses Fedora 44 and GNOME 50. GNOME 50's Wayland session runs through
Mutter's development viewer, displayed full screen inside the Selkies X11
capture session. PipeWire rules classify its video stream for WirePlumber.
The GTK viewer uses Cairo rendering and activates its window at startup to
avoid rendering and input-focus problems observed on this CPU-only host.
Mesa software rendering is limited to two threads to fit the guest CPU and
process limits, including when Firefox starts.
Keyboard events go directly to a private GNOME remote-desktop session through
a mode-0600 Unix socket in the guest. The pinned Selkies keyboard dispatch is
patched at build time; assertions reject an unexpected upstream implementation.
Disconnect and blur release held keys. The host waits for the initialized
`ephemio-input` process before marking this profile ready.
The Fedora s6 dependency order starts GNOME and its input socket before Selkies.
Browser acceptance checks wait for GNOME's overview to open before typing into
search; opening the overview and immediately typing can lose the first keys.
This is an experimental container adaptation; the base retains Fedora's
Container Image identity in `/etc/os-release`.
Firefox startup exceeded a 512-task cap during acceptance, so this profile uses
a bounded 768-task cap. CPU and memory limits remain 2 CPUs and 3 GiB.
Sustained application performance still needs measurement on this profile.

Desktop sessions disable screen locking and idle suspension; access is governed
by portal credentials, short-lived browser grants and the session deadline.
Audio plays through the browser from the container's virtual audio sink.

Images share layers. `docker images` sizes cannot be added to determine disk
usage. Inspect `df -h /` and `docker system df -v`. On a shared host, remove only
identified Ephemio test containers and obsolete image IDs. Do not run global
prune commands. Keep configured images and enough space for rebuilds and guest
data; admission currently requires at least 20 GiB free.
