# Ephemio host service

The deployed POC runs Python 3.12 and aiohttp 3.14.3. `service.py` has four roles:

- `worker`: private Unix-socket API, Docker lifecycle, durable SQLite state and expiry.
- `gateway`: signed host API, single-use ticket exchange and authorized HTTP/WebSocket proxy.
- `sync`: authenticated reconciliation with the PHP portal every 15 seconds.
- `sweep`: expiry/recovery fallback when the worker is not holding its supervisor lock.

Systemd units, an Nginx virtual host and bridge-scoped firewall rules are included.
The firewall template contains the first host's public IP; adapt it for each new
host. Container IPv6 is disabled. Existing project networks are outside these rules.

Private configuration lives at `/etc/ephemio/config.json` (root:ephemio, mode 0640):

```json
{
  "host_id": "host-0002",
  "host_url": "https://host-0002.ephemio.com",
  "portal_url": "https://ephemio.com",
  "portal_origins": ["https://ephemio.com", "https://www.ephemio.com"],
  "signing_key": "GENERATE_A_SEPARATE_RANDOM_SECRET_FOR_EACH_HOST",
  "image": "lscr.io/linuxserver/webtop@sha256:TESTED_DIGEST",
  "profiles": {
    "ubuntu-kde": {"image": "lscr.io/linuxserver/webtop@sha256:TESTED_DIGEST", "process": "plasmashell"},
    "ubuntu-gnome": {"image": "sha256:TESTED_IMAGE_ID", "process": "gnome-shell"},
    "fedora-gnome": {"image": "sha256:TESTED_IMAGE_ID", "process": "ephemio-input", "pids_limit": 768},
    "mint-cinnamon": {"image": "sha256:TESTED_IMAGE_ID", "process": "cinnamon"}
  },
  "state": "/var/lib/ephemio",
  "gateway_state": "/var/lib/ephemio-gateway",
  "socket": "/run/ephemio/worker.sock",
  "slots": 1,
  "port": 8090
}
```

The gateway has no Docker socket. Its Unix socket access is restricted to the
`ephemio` group. The worker has Docker/host privileges; customers never receive
host SSH credentials or access to these files.

Build and test the [custom images](../images/README.md) before registering their
immutable IDs. Health responses advertise the configured profile IDs, which the
portal uses when choosing a host. A session's profile is immutable. Existing
SQLite sessions migrate to `ubuntu-kde`; a host without `profiles` retains the
legacy KDE-only behavior. The portal deployment migrates its database without
resetting accounts or session history.
Profiles default to a 512-task cap. Fedora's GNOME/Firefox startup uses a
768-task cap; all profiles retain the same 2 CPU and 3 GiB memory limits.

`portal_url` is the backend reconciliation endpoint. `portal_origins` explicitly
lists browser origins allowed to exchange tickets, including the portal's `www`
alias. Renewal messages target the validated requesting origin. Other origins,
including missing or `null` origins, are rejected before ticket consumption.

## Operations

```bash
sudo systemctl status ephemio-worker ephemio-gateway ephemio-sync ephemio-sweep.timer
sudo journalctl -u ephemio-worker -u ephemio-gateway -u ephemio-sync --since '10 minutes ago'
sudo systemctl restart ephemio-worker ephemio-gateway ephemio-sync
sudo /opt/ephemio-venv/bin/python /opt/ephemio/tests/test_security.py
```

Stopping the worker stops dependent services; the independent sweep timer keeps
checking owned desktop resources. A deleted session cannot be recreated with
its original ID. Containers, volumes and networks require ownership labels before
removal. Avoid global prune commands on this shared host.

Secrets, raw tickets and cookies are excluded from application access logs.
The service has one slot, 2 CPU/3 GiB memory limits, a five-second lifecycle loop
and a sampled 5 GiB disk usage cutoff. This is a trusted-tester POC on a shared
kernel. See the [deployment report](../../docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for observed checks
and remaining limitations.
